The batch file MakeProg.bat constructs a MAKE-file, named makefile, and
executes a MAKE-utility.

The memory model for Microsoft and Borland C compilers is set to LARGE
for all examples. This means that the LARGE libraries are necessary; see
the file ..\lib\makelib.doc for info on building libraries.

The files MakeProg.* builds a MAKE-file which contains the rules for the
building of an example and should be understand by most MAKE-utilities;
if not, you have to make one yourself.

You can obtain a MAKE-file by supplying a dummy MAKE-utility, for example:

   MakeLib bcc simple pause

which will replace the execution of a MAKE-utility by the PAUSE statement.
