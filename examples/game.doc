The GAME example (as the name says, a small game) exist of the following
files:

 - game.c     source file (partly Borland C, partly Microsoft C)
 - game.kb    knowledge base

The game example is an application of RICE for playing the game tick-tack-toe,
also known as tic-tac-toc.

Starting the program without command-line arguments will result in playing
the game against the expert system. When you start up the program with an
knowledge base file as argument it will result in a game between the standard
knwoledge base and the knowledge base entered as command-line argument. For
example:

   game game.kb [ENTER]

will cause the expert system to play against a copy of itself. Probably you
can make better knowledge base which is much better...

See file RICE.DOC for more info on RICE.
