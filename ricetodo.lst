The things to be left for future releases (to which you can contribute... ;-):

 - extend the aggregation of multiple conclusions for the same fact; now
   the aggregation consist of a simple average (arithmetic mean)

 - a better parser should be written; preferably by using bison and flex

 - whatever you come up with...
