RICE is a fuzzy/multi-valued logic inference engine
implemented as a C library. A C++ front-end by
means of a wrapping class is provided. The library has been tested
with <EM>Borland C/C++</EM>, <EM>Microsoft C/C++</EM> and <EM>GNU
C/C++</EM>.  Documentation is available in <EM>WordPerfect 5.1</EM>
format (sorry ;-) or <EM>PostScript</EM>. RICE was used for some
of the experiments I did during my research in the field of
