   Info:   documentation for updating RICE 3.x applications
*/


This file will explain how to update applications using RICE 3.x software.
In fact the update will not be so hard. For upgrading RICE 3.x applications
for using the RICE 4.0 library functions, three ways of upgrading are
possible:

 - Replace RICE.H and RICE.C with RICE3X.H and RICE3X.C. This should be
   done in source and include files as well as in make and project files.

 - If you was used to include RICE.C directly in your application code,
   instead of compiling seperately, you can still do this, but include the
   UPGRADE directory in the include search path of the compiler.

 - If you was used to include RICE.H in your application and compile RICE.C
   seperately, you should compile your application with RICE_UPGRADE defined.
   The file RICE.C can be compiled as normal.

An example of this upgrading (SIMPLE3X; can be found in EXAMPLES directory)
can be found in the EXAMPLES directory. See the file SIMPLE3X.DOC for more
info. See the file RICE.DOC for more info on RICE.
