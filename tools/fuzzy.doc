1. Introduction

This file is the document-file related to FUZZY.H and FUZZY.C. These
files can be used in combination with, for example, RICE or any other
program.

Several functions are available for:

 - membership functions
 - fuzzy logical operators
 - defuzzification methods
 - miscellaneous functions

All function names start with an 'f'. The functions will be discussed in
the following sections.


2. Membership Functions

Two types of membership functions are distinguished

 - smooth membership functions

      float fpi(float val, float p1, float p2, float p3, float p4)
      float fdelta(float val, float p1, float p2, float p3)
      float fgamma(float val, float p1, float p2)
      float flambda(float val, float p1, float p2)

 - straigth membership functions

      float ftrapezium(float val, float p1, float p2, float p3, float p4)
      float ftriangle(float val, float p1, float p2, float p3)
      float fblock(float val, float p1, float p2)

All return a membership grade in the interval [0, 1].


3. Fuzzy Operators

The standard implementation of negation (not), and three implementations 
of intersection (and) and union (or) are available:

 - intersection operators

      float *fzand(int len, float *dest, float *src)
      float *fland(int len, float *dest, float *src)
      float *fpand(int len, float *dest, float *src)
                         
 - union operators

      float *fzor(int len, float *dest, float *src)
      float *flor(int len, float *dest, float *src)
      float *fpor(int len, float *dest, float *src)

 - negation operator

      float *fnot(int len, float *dest)

In which 'z', 'p' and 'l' stands for Zadeh, Probability and Lukasiewicz
respectivily. Note that in those functions the argument named 'dest' will
be changed. In case the 'len' argument is negative it is assumed that the
'src' argument contains only one element. The 'dest' argument should always
be an array of minimal 'len' (or -'len') floats.

Additional functions are available for applying general, user defined,
norm operators:

 - general norm

      float *fnorm(int len, float *dest, float *src,
                   float (*norm)(float, float));

 - general extended norm

      float *fxnorm(int len, float *dest, float *src,
                   float (*norm)(float, float), float par);
 
These functions need an function calculating the desired norm as argument.


4. Defuzzification Methods

Two main types of defuzzification are available, the second is a special
case of the first:

 - centre-of-gravity (normal and indexed)

      float fcog(int len, float *set)
      float ficog(int len, float *set, float lim)

 - mean-of-maxima

      float fmom(int len, float *set)

The application of the (indexed-)fuzzy-mean defuzzification method can be
performed using the f(i)cog functions.


5. Miscellaneous Functions

In addition to the above discussed functions and macro's also the following
functions are available:

 - height of fuzzy set

      float fhgt(int len, float *set)

 - alpha-cuts (normal and strong)

      float *fcut(int len, float *dest, float *src, float cut)
      float *fscut(int len, float *dest, float *src, float cut)
