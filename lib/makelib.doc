The batch file MakeLib.bat constructs a MAKE-file, named makefile, and
executes a MAKE-utility.

The memory model for Microsoft and Borland C compilers is set to LARGE.
You need to set an environment varaible to overrule this:

   set RICEMODEL=...

The file MakeLib.bat builds a MAKE-file, which contains the rules for
making a library and should be understand by most MAKE-utilities; if not,
you have to make one yourself.

You can obtain a MAKE-file by supplying a dummy MAKE-utility, for example:

   MakeLib bcc pause

which will replace the execution of a MAKE-utility by the PAUSE statement.

If you use Gnu CC (DJGPP for MS-DOS) and using the toolbox, you can copy
the library `rice.a' to `\djgpp\lib\librice.a', which enables the use of
the `-lrice' switch for GCC.
